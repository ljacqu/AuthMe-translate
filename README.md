AuthMe Translation Interface
----------------------------
Source code for a translation interface
allowing users to create and edit translations for
[AuthMe](https://github.com/AuthMe-Team/AuthMeReloaded), a Minecraft
authentication plugin. No longer in use.

Pull request are much appreciated, especially for improving the
design of the web page (_hint hint_).

Since this is tightly coupled with AuthMe, please report any issues
to the [AuthMeReloaded](https://github.com/Xephi/AuthMeReloaded/issues)
project.
